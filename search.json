[{"title":"Start blog with Hexo","url":"/2020/11/05/Start-blog-with-Hexo/","content":"Beginning...\n===============\n\nI finally decided to start blog to save memories from my IT journey. Don't get me wrong \ni tried to start own blog many times(too many :-D) but this time I'm really doing this!\nAfter some research i decided to go with Hexo because of Node.js and simplicity.\n<br/>\nI will shortly guide you how to setup Hexo on Github. \nInstruction of pages repository creation can be found at [GitHub](https://pages.github.com/) it is \neasy and well explained so o won't go through it here.\nLet's focus on Hexo now:\n<br/>\n\n## Install npm \nFirst of all you will need to install npm if you dont have it already.(npm is distributed with Node.js)\n\n*  **Mac**\n <br/>`curl`\n{% codeblock %}\ncurl \"https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/node-${VERSION:-$(wget -qO- https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/ | sed -nE 's|.*>node-(.*)\\.pkg</a>.*|\\1|p')}.pkg\" > \"$HOME/Downloads/node-latest.pkg\" && sudo installer -store -pkg \"$HOME/Downloads/node-latest.pkg\" -target \"/\"\n{% endcodeblock %}\n<br/>`Homebrew`\n{% codeblock %}brew install node{% endcodeblock %}\n<br/>`Mac pkg`\nJust download and install package from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current)\n<br/>\n\n*  **Windows**\n<br/>`Scoop`\n{% codeblock %}scoop install nodejs{% endcodeblock %}\n<br/>`Chocolatey`\n{% codeblock %}choco install nodejs{% endcodeblock %}\n<br/>`msi installer`\nDownload and install Windows Installer (.msi) from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current)\n<br/>\n\n## Install Hexo\nAfter we got Node.js the installation of Hexo is straightforward:\n{% codeblock %}npm install hexo-cli -g{% endcodeblock %}\n\n## Setup\nNow let's create our project with Hexo\n{% codeblock %}hexo init PROJECT_NAME{% endcodeblock %}\nThis will create folder `PROJECT_NAME` and clone Hexo files from GitHub repository\nto our local system.\nnext:\n{% codeblock %}cd PROJECT_NAME & npm install{% endcodeblock %}\nAt this point all necessary files should be in place. To confirm\nwe can run:\n{% codeblock %}hexo server{% endcodeblock %}\nThis will start Hexo local server and allow us to view our blog in web browser\nunder address mentioned in command output (`http://localhost:4000`).\nAnd here it is\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/pZRwOa5.png)\n<br/>\n\nOk! but this is only \"Hello World\" template so press CTRL+C and let's start configuration.\n<br/>\n* **Theme**\nYou can create own theme or if you like me and can't wait to start blogging use one from already existing. Lot's of themes can be found on Hexo [website](https://hexo.io/themes/). Installation of themes is very easy: \n\t+ Pick theme \n\t+ clone it to theme folder \n\t+ edit _config.yml with {% codeblock %}theme: THEME_NAME{% endcodeblock %}\n\nThemes have they own _config.yml in which we can edit menu items, title etc. I'm pretty sure anybody can hadle configuration and customization of theme.\n<br/>\n* **_config.yml**\nFor overal explenation please visit https://hexo.io/docs/configuration.html.\nFrom my side i would sugest to install [hexo-deployer-git](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-deployer-git).\n{% codeblock %}npm install hexo-deployer-git --save{% endcodeblock %}\nThen in main `_config.yml` add:\n{% codeblock %}\ndeploy:\n  type: git\n  repository:\n    github: <repository url>\n{% endcodeblock %}\nfrom now on every time when you will use {% codeblock %}hexo deploy{% endcodeblock %} it will push your website\nstraight to Github! Isn't that awesome ?\nThere is one more plugin that i highly recommend to install it's called [hexo-backup-git](https://github.com/coneycode/hexo-git-backup)\nThis will backup your whole hexo configuration so if you get into some trouble with some config or just want to get access to it from other computer\nit is the best and quickest solution in my opinion.\nInstallation is easy as always:\n{% codeblock %}npm install hexo-git-backup --save{% endcodeblock %}\nas always add proper configuration in `_config.yml`\n{% codeblock %}\nbackup:\n    type: git\n    repository:\n       github: <repository url>\n{% endcodeblock %}\nusage of this plugin is same as in previous, to backup configuration type in terminal\n{% codeblock %}hexo backup{% endcodeblock %} or {% codeblock %}hexo b{% endcodeblock %}\n\n## Start blogging\nAfter configuring Hexo, blogging is just a breeze:\n* create new post md file\n{% codeblock %}hexo new POST_FILE_NAME{% endcodeblock %}\n* create new page md file\n{% codeblock %}hexo new page PAGE_FILE{% endcodeblock %}\n* Cleans the cache file (db.json) and generated files (public).\n{% codeblock %}hexo clean{% endcodeblock %}\n* start hexo server to see changes locally\n{% codeblock %}hexo server or hexo s{% endcodeblock %}\n* my favourite - website deploy\n{% codeblock %}hexo deploy{% endcodeblock %}\n\nNow you should be ready to start your blog journey on GitHub just like me. Good luck!\n","tags":["Hexo","blog","setup"]}]
